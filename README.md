# App Tracker (Project)

An intuitive job application dashboard that keeps track of all of the jobs that you have applied for. Each application contains metrics and information like the date you have applied, the link to the application, the application status, etc. The underlying backend will be using AWS serverless and cloud technology (TBD which specific services).

## Features
- Query job applications by company, title
- Filter job applications by date applied, status, company
- Add job applications
- Update job status (applied, ghosted, rejected, interview, offer)
- Delete job applications
